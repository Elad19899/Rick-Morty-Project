# Rick-Morty-Project

** NOTE !!! **

The first and most important process (and this is because of the file upload limit that failed)

1. Open a new folder under the name of the project = Rick_Morty_Project
2. Insert the API_Tests folders and the UI_Tests folder under the project's main folder
3. Open the IDE and upload the project

Before you can run the file code you need to do a few actions:

1. Install Selenium through the terminal === pip install -U selenium
2. Install the Pytest framework through the terminal === pip install -U pytest

 ** As soon as you install the libraries, you will see a venv folder under which all the libraries are installed under the bin and lib folders. **

 THX!
